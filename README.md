Modern Art can be viewed in a positive or unfavourable light
1.  I might consider Modern Art to be a lamentable loss if it is produced solely as a way to gain fame and Fortune.  Interestingly other forms of modern art like graffiti might be considered pernicious if it's ruining someone's property or life.  Should I be honest I would have to say that I view Modern art to be an eminent source of happiness and thus a grandiose joy for civilization because it provides mankind with "food for the soul".  In line with this view, one might argue that appreciating the aesthetic qualities of a painting (like Monet) is what makes us human; an important quality to harbour, especially in these days of budget cuts and technological innovation.
